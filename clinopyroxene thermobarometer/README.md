# Clinopyroxene thermobarometry
> **Clinopyroxene thermobarometry is a scientific method that uses the mineral clinopyroxene to determine the temperature and pressure of the magma when the mineral crystalized.** 

- This project will compare the application of different machine learning methods in clinopyroxene pyrometer, including classical machine learning methods such as linear regression, CART decision tree, random forest, ExTra Tree, XGBoost, etc., and try to improve the results with H2O AUTOML method.

- The project also includes chemistry and mineralogy, which were completed by other members of the team.
